## FuelFit – Your Personal Fitness Guide
**FuelFit** is a full-stack fitness tracking application designed to help you stay consistent on your health journey.
It allows users to set their fitness goals, monitor daily nutrition, track progress, and receive personalized meal suggestions based on their preferences.

## Inspiration Behind FuelFit
The idea for FuelFit came from observing a common struggle in the gym — especially among beginners.
After a workout, many new members would often ask: 

 **“What should I eat now?”**

 **“Is this food good for my body ?”**

With so many food options available in the market, beginners easily get confused about what to eat, when to eat, and how much to eat. Seeing this confusion regularly, I thought:

**Why not build something that gives personalized meal suggestions based on fitness goals?**

That's how **FuelFit** was born — a platform that automatically provides daily meal recommendations, tracking progress based on individual goals and preferences.

FuelFit helps users know exactly what to eat and when to eat so they can stay consistent and focused on their fitness journey.
